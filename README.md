# BowlingGame
This is a code challenge for OnSharp, it's a simple bowling game as a console app.

## How to use
Source files: Either download the latest source files and run it inside VS or build it and run the exe in the debug folder.\
Release: download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Ozir1z/BownlingGame/releases), unzip and run the exe.

## How it works:
A player gets to play 10 frames (10 turns), 2 throws per turn.

You can run the console app and give a number of pins you want to hit per roll.

### Types of frames:

**Open Frame**\
If you do not knock down all 10 pins using both shots of your frame (9 or fewer pins knocked down), you have an open frame.
How to score: An open frame only earns the number of pins knocked down.

**Spare**\
If you knock down all 10 pins using both shots of a frame, you get a spare.
How to score: A spare earns 10 points plus the sum of your next shot.

**Strike**\
If you knock down all 10 pins in the first shot of a frame, you get a strike.
How to score: A strike earns 10 points plus the sum of your next two shots.
